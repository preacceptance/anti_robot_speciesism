He believes the human mind is the same as the human soul.

To me, focusing on the biological factor of consciousness is important. Our brains are in a way programmed to work a certain way but have inconsistencies and complexities that can not be truly made in a computer program. It can imitate it, but that does not mean it is truly conscious. 

Having knowledge of programming has also influenced me to believe that it is near impossible to have an AI that has a consciousness similar to a human. Computers can learn and perceive things but are limited by their programming. There aren't even computers that have the power to even come close to the power and space needed for human brains to function in the way it does.
